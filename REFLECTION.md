# Reflection

## What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?
In uniqueHobbies, .map() is like a factory line that strips away everything (day, mood, minutes) except for the hobby name. Analyzing and commenting each line on this code helped me better understand how higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() can simplify data processing. Instead of writing loops manually, these methods allowed the program to express intent more clearly and concisely.

## What was the most confusing part?
Learning each of the higher-ordeer functions and how they operate was time consuming at first. The most confusing part was understanding how reduce() works, especially how the accumulator value changes with each iteration. WHen I traced the values step by step, it became clearer how the total was built.
